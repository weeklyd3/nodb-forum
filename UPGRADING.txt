**Not an actual source file. Upgrading guidelines.**

Preparing for the Upgrade
============================
1. Go to "Banners" and inform users about the 
   downtime. The site will not be able to run 
   while the files are uploading. (Or at least,
   it's risky.)
2. Take your site offline.
3. Download your desired release from GitHub.
4. Your files should be offline.
5. Unzip the file using an archive extraction 
   utility of your choice.
6. Delete tos_raw.php.

Actually Upgrading
============================
7. Upload the files, replacing the exsting ones. 
8. Take the site online.
