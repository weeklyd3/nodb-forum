contributing to this repository.

## Log in to your GitHub account
An account is required for almost anything.
## Make a local clone!
1. Make a directory where you want to clone the 
   files. Name it something nice!
2. `cd` to the parent directory.
3. Go to https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token to generate a token. Run: `git clone https://github.com/weeklyd3/nodb-forum your-folder`.
   It is assumed that your-folder is the name of the 
   created directory.
4. Enter your username and your token.
5. You'll see something like this:
```
Cloning into 'your-folder'...
