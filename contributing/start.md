You can do anything you want in a commit, fix a bug,
update documentation, anything that's related.

Just make sure that:
 - You're doing one task! It's fine to stage multiple
   files, but don't do two tasks in one commit.
 - You're not conflicting with someone else. If someone 
   else was assigned to a task, don't do it for them unless 
   they tell you to.
